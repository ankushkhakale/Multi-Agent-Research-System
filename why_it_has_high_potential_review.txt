## Academic Peer Review Report

### Summary and Verdict

This paper presents a highly relevant and timely analysis of utilizing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms (VQE with ZNE) to tackle NP-hard optimization problems (QUBO) within the constraints of current NISQ hardware. The theoretical foundation is sound, the methodology is appropriate for the stated goal, and the expected results are ambitious yet quantifiable. The paper is well-structured and maintains a strong academic tone.

The core argument—that noise mitigation (ZNE) is essential for realizing even a near-term advantage—is critical and well-integrated into the proposed methodology.

**Verdict:** **ACCEPTED**, pending mandatory minor revisions focused on increasing technical specificity, particularly regarding the implementation details of the Ansatz and the context of the expected hardware execution.

| **Equations** | Satisfactory | Mathematical notation is used for the Hamiltonian, though line breaks/formatting could be slightly cleaner. |
| **References** | Needs Revision | Placeholder citations are used. These must be replaced with fully formatted IEEE references in the final version. |

### 2. Clarity and Academic Tone

The paper exhibits a high level of clarity and maintains a consistent, formal academic tone throughout.

*   **Terminology:** Concepts like superposition, entanglement, VQE, QUBO, and ZNE are used correctly and precisely.
*   **Narrative Flow:** The introductory sections successfully build a compelling case, transitioning smoothly from the limits of classical computing to the necessity of NISQ-era solutions.
*   **Thesis Clarity:** The "High Potential Thesis" is clearly defined as the pursuit of quantum computational advantage, providing a clear goal for the research.

**Suggestion for Tone/Clarity:** While the term "High Potential" is used effectively as a thesis statement, consider standardizing the language in the abstract and introduction to strictly use the established academic term **"quantum computational advantage"** or **"quantum advantage"** to enhance precision.

### 3. Technical Soundness (Logic and Flow)

The technical arguments presented are sound and logically structured.

*   **Problem Framing:** The identification of NP-hard problems (QUBO) as a primary target for VQE is appropriate, as VQAs are currently the most viable algorithms for optimization on NISQ devices.
*   **Methodology (VQE):** The description of VQE is accurate, covering the essential steps: Hamiltonian mapping, Ansatz preparation, quantum evaluation, and classical optimization.
*   **Noise Mitigation:** The inclusion of Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) is technically robust. ZNE is a necessary component for achieving reliable results on current hardware, demonstrating the authors’ understanding of practical quantum constraints.
*   **Expected Results:** The metrics chosen (approximation ratio $\rho$, fidelity improvement, complexity scaling, $N_{crit}$) are excellent indicators of potential success and align with current quantum research benchmarks.

**Minor Logic Check:** The paper mentions that VQAs "inherently mitigate the effects of quantum noise over extended computational cycles" (Section 2.3). While the classical loop helps prevent error accumulation from catastrophic decoherence (by resetting the quantum state), VQAs do *not* inherently mitigate gate errors within a single circuit run. This phrasing might be slightly misleading. The reliance on ZNE (Section 3.3) is the true noise mitigation strategy.

### 4. Suggestions for Improvement

To elevate this draft to a publication-ready standard, the following revisions are mandatory or highly recommended:

#### A. Specificity in Methodology

1.  **Ansatz Specification:** In Section 3.2 (VQE Implementation), the authors state that a "hardware-efficient Ansatz (HEA) is often chosen." This needs to be specified. Which HEA will be utilized for the QUBO mapping? (e.g., $R_y$ layers followed by linear or circular CNOT entanglement layers). The specific choice significantly impacts circuit depth and trainability (the barren plateau problem).
2.  **Optimizer Choice:** While COBYLA and ADAM are mentioned, the authors should justify their choice of classical optimizer for the VQE loop. For noisy systems, gradient-free optimizers like COBYLA or SPSA are often preferred over gradient-based methods like ADAM. Clarify which one will be used and why.
3.  **ZNE Implementation Details:** Briefly specify the noise scaling factors or methods intended for ZNE (e.g., digital or analog scaling, linear or exponential extrapolation).

#### B. Contextualizing Expected Results

1.  **Hardware Context for $N \le 30$:** In Section 4.1, the target $N \le 30$ is critical. The authors must clarify if these are expected results from:
    *   a) A classical simulator (e.g., using Qiskit Aer) for benchmarking, or
    *   b) A physical NISQ device (e.g., a specific IBM or IonQ machine).
    The performance and noise characteristics differ drastically. If using a physical device, specify which one (or which type of architecture, e.g., superconducting).
2.  **Clarifying Speedup Claims:** The term "super-polynomial speedup" (Section 4.2.1) is strong. While VQE/QAOA holds promise, the current consensus is that a guaranteed super-polynomial speedup has not yet been proven for arbitrary optimization problems, unlike Shor's algorithm. For VQAs, it is often referred to as a "heuristic quantum advantage." Ensure the language reflects that the speedup analysis is *theoretical* and contingent on specific problem instances (as correctly noted for Max-Cut).

#### C. Formatting and References

1.  **Complete References:** Replace all placeholder citations with complete, IEEE-formatted references, ensuring the cited works directly support the claims made (e.g., the specific characteristics of superconducting vs. trapped-ion qubits).
2.  **Equation Formatting:** Ensure the Hamiltonian equations are centered and numbered if they are referenced later in the text. (Currently, they are not numbered, which is acceptable if they are not referenced, but numbering is standard for key definitions.)
